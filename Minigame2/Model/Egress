You walk into the room you woke up from and walk past the creepy portraits and up to the locked exit door. With the
key in hand you are able to unlock the vault door and open it. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, it's a
beautiful day outside and you are very relieved to walk out of the dungeon alive. You made it! Congratulations!

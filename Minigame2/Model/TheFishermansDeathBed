The wall's of this room are heavily decorated with trophy's, and old fishing pictures.
After admiring the glorious walls, your eyes settle onto a very unfortunate scene:
a withered old man struggling to get his last words out on his death bed.
"My name is old man Jenkins, I was the greatest fisherman that ever lived.. here son, take my rod.
I've no need for it anymore..." Jenkins mutters as he dissolves into dust.
> Use "take" command to pick up the "rod".
You can only go WEST from here.

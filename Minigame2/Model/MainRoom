You enter into a big room with very different doors in every direction.
The door to the EAST has a very eerie fog crawling out from underneath it.
The door to the NORTH is surrounded by piles of precious gold coins.
The door to the WEST has what sounds like a child's voice calling out from the other side.
The door to the SOUTH has a sign that reads "egress" above it.
Where will you go?
You can move EAST, NORTH, WEST, and SOUTH from here.

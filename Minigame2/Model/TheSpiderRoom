You walk into a room excited by the idea of potential treasure.
Unfortunately, all is not as it seems, there is no treasure.
Instead, glowing red eyes come forward out of the darkness to reveal two monster spiders.
Fortunately, you have your trusty gauntlet on.
Your eyes glow white as you prepare to bash both spiders into oblivion.
> Enter the "attack" command to kill the "spiders".
You can now continue to the other end of the room where sitting on a pile of coins is a shiny key.
> Use the "take" command to pick up the "cellarKey".
You can move SOUTH or UP from here.

You are out of breath after climbing a long spiral staircase.
You are in the attic and there is a cell.
A prisoner is behind bars its bars as he begs you to free him.
He promises to give you something in return if you do...
> Do you free him with the key you just found? Answer "YES" or "NO".
*IF YES* You have freed the prisoner! He gives you another key that says "Egress" as thanks.
*IF NO* In your selfishness you decide not to free the prisoner.
You end up wandering the dungeon for days on end, to no avail.
You die a selfishness and sad death. Game Over!
You can only move DOWN from here.

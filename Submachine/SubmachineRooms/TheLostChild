There are toys absolutely everywhere in this room.
If you were still a kid you would never want to leave this toy heaven.
There is a small child playing with a toy robot in the corner.
"There's a toy at the bottom of the cavern river, I want it! I want it!", the child exclaims.
As you scan the room you can see a hatch on the floor, almost buried by the toys.
You can only move DOWN and EAST from here.

As you finish climbing down a dingy sewer ladder you are met with a beautiful cavern,
glistening with all different types of crystals.
You can hear the squealing of bats overhead and there is a river at the other end of the cavern.
You peer over the river and see the "toy" that the child was talking about at the bottom of the river.
Only it's not a toy, it looks to be something else...
if only you had something to help get it out of the bottom of the water.
> Use the "take" command to grab the "gauntlet" *ONLY IF* you have a "rod"
You acquire a rusty gauntlet with the fisherman's rod!
You can only move UP from here.
